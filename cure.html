    How UTEROCLEAR Works to Permanently Shrink & Eliminate Fibroids

    <h2>Your Journey to Healing</h2>
    <p class="subtitle"><b>
      This is how the UTEROCLEAR works inside your body — step by step — and what most women notice within 30 days.
    </p></b>

    <!-- MECHANISM STEPS -->
    <div class="steps-grid">
      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">1</span>
        <h4>Nutrients Enter the Bloodstream</h4>
        <p>
          Once taken, the herbal nutrients are absorbed into your bloodstream and directed straight to the womb and reproductive organs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">2</span>
        <h4>Targets Fibroids Directly</h4>
        <p>
          The formula targets fibroid tissues, gradually cutting off their blood supply — causing them to shrink naturally over time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">3</span>
        <h4>Cleanses the Womb</h4>
        <p>
          As fibroids break down, dead tissues, toxins, and waste are flushed out naturally through the body’s detox pathways.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step-card">
        <span class="step-number">4</span>
        <h4>Restores Hormonal Balance</h4>
        <p>
          Hormones are regulated to stop new fibroids from forming and to support a healthy, fertile womb environment.
        </p>
      </div>

He told me to come back in 30 days & he would do another sonogram to see if things had changed. I got on the internet & found fibroid shrink solution capsules & read of similar situations that the product had helped so I decided to try it. 
        I took it as recommended & went back to the Dr. & my sonogram was totally clear after 30 days. He was surprised & so was I !”</b></p>
